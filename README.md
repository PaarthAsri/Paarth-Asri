👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm Paarth Asri, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast based in New Delhi, India. I specialize in offensive security, vulnerability research, and threat analysis. With hands-on experience in penetration testing and red team simulations, I enjoy exploring system weaknesses and building stronger defenses.

I'm currently pursuing my BCA at VIPS-TC, and I've interned with organizations like DigiSuraksha Parhari Foundation and IBM, where I strengthened my skills in ethical hacking and web development.

My toolkit includes tools like Metasploit, BeEF, Bettercap, Wireshark, Nmap, and more. I build and break to learn—and I'm always up for a new security challenge. 🛡️💻
