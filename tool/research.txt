### RESEARCH ABOUT CAN PROTOCOL

### *1. CAN Protocol Security Flaws (Research Findings)*  
#### *A. Inherent Design Weaknesses*  
- *No Authentication/Encryption*:  
  CAN protocol prioritizes low latency and reliability over security, leaving messages unauthenticated and unencrypted.

- *Broadcast Nature*:  
  All nodes receive all messages, enabling eavesdropping and spoofing.

#### *B. Attack Surfaces*  
- *Remote Exploitation*:  
  Telematics systems (e.g., infotainment, cellular modules) act as gateways to CAN bus.  
  - Example: Miller & Valasek’s Jeep hack (2015) exploited a Sprint cellular modem to send malicious CAN messages.  
- *Physical Access*:  
  OBD-II ports allow direct CAN bus access.

### *3. Exploitation Frequency & Trends*  
#### *A. Quantifying Attacks*  
- *Underreported*:  
  Automotive manufacturers rarely disclose breaches due to liability concerns.  
  - Source: Upstream Auto Cybersecurity Report (2023): 295% increase in automotive API/CAN attacks since 2018.  
- *Ransomware*:  
  CAN-based attacks in industrial settings (e.g., factories, power grids) are rising but poorly documented.  

#### *B. Research vs. Real-World Exploits*  
- *Academic Demonstrations*:  
  Over 50+ CAN exploits published in top conferences (USENIX, IEEE S&P) since 2010.  
- *Criminal Activity*:  
  Focused on theft (e.g., Kia/Hyundai) and ransomware (e.g., CAN bus DoS in logistics fleets).

- *CAN FD/XL*:  
  Adds frame authentication and partial encryption (ISO 11898-2:2016).  
  - Source: Hartwich (2018), "CAN XL Protocol Update" (CAN in Automation Conference).  

#### *B. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)*  
- *Machine Learning-Based IDS*:  
  Detects anomalies in CAN traffic (e.g., message frequency, payload patterns).  
  - Source: Song et al. (2020), "Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for CAN Bus Networks" (IEEE IoT Journal).  

#### *C. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)*

### *5. Challenges & Future Directions*  
#### *A. Barriers to Adoption*  
- *Legacy Systems*:  
  Retrofitting security into existing CAN networks is costly (e.g., 300M+ vehicles on road use classic CAN).  
- *Regulatory Gaps*:  
  UN Regulation No. R155 (2021) mandates automotive cybersecurity but lacks CAN-specific enforcement.  

#### *B. Emerging Research*  
- *Quantum-Resistant Cryptography*:  
  Post-quantum algorithms for CAN authentication (e.g., NIST-standardized CRYSTALS-Kyber).  
  - Source: Braun et al. (2023), "Post-Quantum Secure CAN Communication" (ACM CCS).

### *Conclusion*  
The CAN protocol’s security flaws have been extensively documented in research, with real-world exploits ranging from vehicle thefts to industrial sabotage. While mitigations like CAN FD and ML-based IDS show promise, legacy systems and slow regulatory adoption remain critical hurdles. Future work must prioritize retrofitting security and standardizing post-quantum protections.
